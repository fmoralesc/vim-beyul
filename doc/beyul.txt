                                  VIM-BEYUL

Super experimental hypertext mode for vim, inspired by Ted Nelson's Xanadu
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu, http://xanadu.com).

- IDEA                                                        *vim-beyul-idea*

The beyul fileformat describes how to build up a document. Vim interprets this
description to present the document (on `BufReadCmd`). On writes
(`BufWriteCmd`), the description is updated. If the description sources from
external documents, changes on those will change the document.
